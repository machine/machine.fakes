    "description": "Machine.Fakes attempts to simplify the usage of such frameworks on top of Machine.Specifications by helping to reduce a lot of the typical fake framwork related clutter code in specifications. If you choose so, Machine.Fakes even helps you to stay mostly independent of a concrete fake framework by providing a little wrapper API and a provider model for fake frameworks. ",
